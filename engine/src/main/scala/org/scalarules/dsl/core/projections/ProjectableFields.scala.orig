/**
  * Domain objects in the DSL can allow access to their fields through projections.
  * This trait signals the support of field projections and provides a convenience
  * method to create these projections.
  *
  * Here's an example:
  *
  * {{{
  *   case class Person(val name: String)
  *
  *   class PersonFieldProjections(personFact: SingularFact[Person]) extends ProjectableFields[Person] {

  *   object PersonImplicits {
  *     implicit def toPersonFieldProjections(personFact: SingularFact[Person]): PersonFieldProjections = new PersonFieldProjections(personFact)
  *   }
  * }}}
  *
  * With these elements in place, you can import the PersonImplicits._ where you want to use it in your
  * DSL and you can refer to the `name` field of any `Fact` of type `Person`.
  *
  * @tparam C type from which the field(s) can be projected.
